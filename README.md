# Locomotion

## What is Locomotion?

Locomotion is a beta open-source rider/passenger mobile app written in React Native and Node.js that can be customized and modified to support any ride-hailing, ride-sharing, or mobility as a service operation. Make spinning up rides as simple as spinning up servers on the cloud.

The app comes pre-integrated to autofleet's backend ride engine that matches rides to available vehicles from partner fleets. The map provider of your choice, payment/billing services, CRM platforms and more can be easily built into **Locomotion**.

## Usage

Locomotion is pre-integrated to the Autofleet platform, which offers the full dispatching and route optimization, driver management, and fleet maangement platform to power any ride-based service.

Holler to the team @ autofleet.io: The first ever Vehicle as a Service platform for fleets

Looking forward to the future of autonomous vehicles, ride-hailing platforms will be powered by optimized autonomous fleets, providing elastic supply to serve any source of demand. The barrier to entry for new ride-hailing services will be reduced, as anyone can tap into the fleet supply to make a ride. Autofleet is making this future a reality, starting today. By working with the largest fleets on the planet, we're creating an elastic supply with traditional vehicles that can serve any source of demand. Locomotion is one more step towards this vision, giving everyone the basic tools to start building a ride-hailing service, from the comfort of their own home.
